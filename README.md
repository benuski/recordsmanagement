It is really freaking hard to evaluate or compare records retention series across agencies, localities, and states in the United States. They are often in databases, pdfs, or html, and that is if they are even online at all. It is my goal to change that. I want to make as many retention schedules and retention series available to the records management community as a whole, because we don't need to be duplicating all this effort on writing series.

Where possible, I will document under what permission I am obtaining the retention schedules, but I am operating under the assumption that state regulations, such as records retention schedules, are not copyrightable as they are part of the laws of various states. If any state or agency wishes to contribute machine readable versions that I was not able to find, I welcome that.
