It is really freaking hard to evaluate or compare records retention series across agencies, localities, and states in the United States. They are often in databases, pdfs, or html, and that is if they are even online at all. It is my goal to change that. I want to make as many retention schedules and retention series available to the records management community as a whole, because we don't need to be duplicating all this effort on writing series.
